# pz-monitor-bot
Discord bot for monitoring Project Zomboid Dedicated Server (on Linux)

General idea is to have bot that will monitor server condition and allow users to restart the server when needed. 
This bot will also allow to check Steam Workshop for mods changes and restart server as needed.

This is still work in progress in very early stage of building. This project is also for learning purpouses as this is my first node.js project.
